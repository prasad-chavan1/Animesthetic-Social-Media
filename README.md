## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6 or higher) installed on your system.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (3.2 or higher) installed.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Git]()

## Getting Started

To started working with the project, you need to setup [Postgres Database](#setting-up-database) and [Project](#setting-up-project) which are explained below:

### Setting up Postgres User

1. First, make sure that postgres server is running by `systemctl start` command.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
   ```

2. Then, you can switch to the postgres account by typing

   ```bash
   sudo -i -u postgres
   ```

3. We can create a new role(user) from the command line with the `createuser` command along with `--interactive` flag.

   ```bash
   postgres@server:~$ createuser --interactive
   ```

   _Note: `postgres@server:~$` is the prompt and `createuser --interactive` is the command_`

   The script will prompt you with some choices and, based on your responses execute the correct Postgres commands to your specifications:

   ```
   Output
   Enter the name of role to add: test_user
   Shall the new role be a superuser?(y/n) y
   ```

   _Note: Above is just a example it might be different for you. \*\*Make sure that that role(user) you have created is superuser._

4. Now, its time to add password to created user using `\password test_user`. Execute psql command to prompt into postgres server.

   ```bash
   postgres@server:~$ psql
   ```

   Then you will be prompt to

   ```bash
   postgres=#
   ```

   Type `\password test_user` command and execute.

   ```bash
   postgres=# \password test_user
   ```

   YOu will be prompter to enter and confirm a pasword. Now, exit the PostgreSQL interface using `\q` and exit back to your normal user.

5. Creating database of the user we have created.

   ```bash
   postgres@server:~$ createdb sammy
   ```

### Setting up Postgres Database

1. To create a database for **Animesthetic Scoal Media Web App** we can use `createdb <database_name>` as before.

   ```bash
    postgres@server:~$ createdb social_network
   ```

   _Note: For this project i have created `social_network` database you might create different for you._
